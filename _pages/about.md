“We are all made from stardust” – as a six-year-old, I reasoned that if I were indeed made of stardust, then I must have magical properties. It would be much later that I would discover that Carl Sagan’s stardust was heavy elements scattered around the universe after the explosion of a massive star. Studying the properties of these elements to understanding the physics behind them led to a more deeply founded appreciation of the subject. This got me interested in pursuing physics and astronomy for my undergraduate studies.
 
My curiosity about stardust led me to study experimental and theoretical condensed matter physics through my undergraduate degree. It allowed me to expand my knowledge of materials and elements. These past four years have been a fantastic experience leading to personal development and growth of my knowledge in physics. There was a shift from astronomy when I got exposure to the field of condensed matter physics as an undergraduate research assistant with Dr. Meigan Aronson and Dr. Alannah Hallas for Co-op and work learn.
 
I have grown single crystals of novel quantum materials, characterized the samples, and explored their properties. Currently, I have been studying compounds near a quantum phase transition. These compounds are tuned away from the transition through chemical substitution. We measure their lattice structures with the help of X-Ray diffraction. Furthermore, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy has allowed me to determine the actual chemical composition of the compounds.
 
Collecting more experimental data from measuring specific properties drove me to understand the importance of data science for analyzing such data. I have been using the magnetic property measurement system to gather more information about their magnetic properties and how it varies at different temperatures. Further analysis using python allowed me to classify them as either ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, or antiferromagnetic. I also realized the importance of having clean data and that data visualization was crucial for understanding how the properties vary. This led me to pursue an online certification in Data Science by IBM to know how I can use it to comprehend large-scale experimental data better. Using various lab equipment for research and learning new data science skills interested me in this field. After spending around three years with the current lab, I realized that each day in this field is a continuous learning experience that is new and exciting!
 
The research experience made me more inquisitive about the technological applications of my work, which directed me towards condensed matter theory and quantum computing. Along with creating new compounds, I wanted to learn more about how we could exploit these physical concepts from a theoretical standpoint. I was intrigued by reading papers about computationally analyzing band structures and lattices and how we can tweak them to get a new physical property. This got me thinking about the game-changing applications of theoretical condensed matter physics. That is when I got interested in quantum computing. To learn more about this field, I attended workshops that have given me further knowledge on the foundations of quantum computing and quantum machine learning.
  
I decided to pursue my Honours thesis in a project that is an intersection of theoretical condensed matter physics, machine learning, and quantum computing. I am working under Dr. Roman Krems for my thesis, where we use machine learning to simulate the Hubbard model. Since this is a growing field, there is an increased need to have more and more large-scale experiments. However, due to limitations in current technology, quantum simulations on our classical systems are the best way of moving forward.
 
The project is a collaboration with experimentalist Dr. Joe Salfi and his team from the Electrical and Computer engineering department at UBC. We are focussing on constructing small quantum circuits with 2-quantum dot arrays. We separate the dots within gates by a barrier of a certain width. Electrons hop between these dots and interact with each other within these dots. With this project, I aim to find the best diameters, barrier widths, q-dot distances, and voltages to simulate the Hubbard model. This allows us to gain a deeper understanding of some intricate material properties. We’re using the Monte Carlo method to calculate the 6-dimensional integral that accounts for all the varying control parameters. We are using Gaussian processes and Bayesian optimization to identify the optimal parameters that control the motion of electrons between the dots. This helps in stabilizing the system, thus allowing us to understand how well this model works for understanding material properties.
 
My undergraduate degree led to such a beautiful and fun journey of me exploring physics, from astrophysics to condensed matter physics. Now it’s time for me to have such an immersive journey with further research in condensed matter/ soft matter Physics. Furthermore, graduate studies allows me to be part of meaningful research and study more about topics I am genuinely passionate about.
